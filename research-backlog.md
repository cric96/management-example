| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------ |
| 1        | Allow the simulation execution directly in a web-client.     | 1              | 0      |
| 2        | As a developer, I want a web-based entry point to experiment aggregate programming. | 10             | 8      |
| 3        | As a developer, I want to have a comprehensive vision of an aggregate system for evaluating aggregate programs. | 10             | 8      |
| 4        | As a developer, I want to have a specific vision of the node's state for understanding the single node contribution inside an aggregate system. | 10             | 8      |
| 5        | As a developer, I want to change the aggregate program in execution for changing the overall behavior of an aggregate system. | 20             | 18     |
| 6        | As a developer, I want to request an actuation to a single node for seeing how the aggregate system react. | 15             | 15     |
| 7        | As a developer, I want to configure simulation environment (e.g. number of nodes, neighborhood,..) | 3              | 3      |
| 8        | As a developer, I want to have fine-grained control of a simulation execution (start, stop, ..)  to better understand the aggregate program behavior. | 3              | 3      |
| 9        | Study web worker as a solution to run simulations detached from the javascript UI event-loop | 5              | 5      |
