| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------ |
| 1        | As a developer, I want a web-based entry point to experiment aggregate programming. |                |        |
| 2        | Allow the simulation execution directly in a web-client.      |                |        |
| 3        | As a developer, I want to have a comprehensive vision of an aggregate system for evaluating aggregate programs. |                |        |
| 4        | As a developer, I want to have a specific vision of the node's state for understanding the single node contribution inside an aggregate system. |                |        |
| 5        | As a developer, I want to change the aggregate program in execution for changing the overall behavior of an aggregate system. |                |        |
| 6        | As a developer, I want to request an actuation to a single node for seeing how the aggregate system react. |                |        |
| 7        | As a developer, I want to have fine-grained control of a simulation execution (start, stop, ..)  to better understand the aggregate program behavior. |                |        |
| 8        | Study web worker as a solution to run simulations detached from the javascript UI event-loop |                |        |
