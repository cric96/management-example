| Allow the simulation execution directly in a web-client.     | Test main aggregate functions using Scala.js                 | 1      | 1     | 0     | 0     |       |       |       |       |
| As a developer, I want a web-based entry point to experiment aggregate programming. | Create an html page backbone                                 | 2      | 2     | 2     | 2     |       |       |       |       |
| As a developer, I want to have a comprehensive vision of an aggregate system for evaluating aggregate programs. | Define a general graph model to represent an aggregate system | 1      | 1     | 1     | 0     |       |       |       |       |
|                                                              | Define the model update strategy (e.g. fully functional, MVVM, MVU) | 1      | 1     | 1     | 1     |       |       |       |       |
|                                                              | Choose a render framework that support graph visualization / manipulation | 2      | 2     | 2     | 1     |       |       |       |       |
|                                                              | Adapt the framework into Scala.js                            | 2      | 2     | 2     | 2     |       |       |       |       |

| As a developer, I want to have a specific vision of the node's state for understanding the single node contribution inside an aggregate system. | Enhance graph visualization with specific node information   | 3      | 3     | 3     | 3     |       |       |       |       |
|                                                              | Allow to change node visualization following a specific value | 3      | 3     | 3     | 3     |       |       |       |       |
